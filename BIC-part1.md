# Todo list 

## Logistic regression 
- Why is it a linear classifier 
- Learning rate 
- Bais: why ? 
- Regression vs Classification 
- Forward pass vs backward pass

## Perceptron 
- Different activation functions (Sign and Signmoid function)
- Limitation of Perceptron (linear classifier and XOR problem)

## MLP
- Hyperparameters 
- Universal Approximation 
- Vanishing gradient problem 
- Bias in MLP
### Backpropagation 
- Forward pass 
- Backward pass 
- learning rate 
- examples 

## Deep learning: CNN(convolution neural nets)
- Coevolution operation 
- Pooling 
- Hyperparameters
- ReLu Activation Function
- Backpropogation

## Deep learning: others 
- Deep Autoencoders (Deep learning is not only for supervised learning)

### Deep learning is not all about deep neural nets 
- Deep SVMs 
- Deep Forrest 

### Limitation
- Why is it good or bad 

## Evolutionary Algorithums 
### What are EAs ?
- Inheritance, mutation, selection, crossover 
- Population based algorithum 
- What is EA good at?
### EA framework 
#### EA Details 
- Encoding 
- Fitness function 
##### Selection 
- Selection Pressure 
- Selection methods: Roulette Wheel selection, tournament selection 
##### Stopping criteria 
- Max No. of Generations, Max No of generation without improvement, max No of improvements.

## Neuroneveolution 
### Why ? 
- Compared with Backpropagation: learn (Topology and weights)
- Population based: global optima
- Can use non-differentiable activation function 
### Different Types of evolution 
- Weight only 
- Weight + topology 
- Topology only: NEAT
