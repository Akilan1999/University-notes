# Bio Inspired Computing part 1

## Swarm intelligence 
- Boids: rules; why is this of interest to us?
- Ant colony optimisation: stigmergy, applying it to TSP
- Particle swarm optimisation: including the general algorithm, the role of informants, how velocity updates are done, the role of hyperparameters

### Sus question 
- What is stigmergy? How can it be used to find the shortest path through a graph?
- In what ways does PSO differ from an EA?

## Genetic programming 
- Makes notes of the main table 

### Sus question 
- What is closure and why is it an issue for KozaGP?
- What is bloat and why is it a problem? 
- What is the principal motivation for using <GP type>?
- Which form of GP would be best for <insert situation>?
- What arethechallengesfaced by GP?
- What are the trade-offs in designing a GP system, or between different types of GP systems?

## Multi objective EA
- Be aware of what kind of problem they're used for 
- Dominance, non-dominated sets and fronts 
- The use of sparsity measures to promote diversity
-
### NSGA-II
- Understand how it works 
- Be able to give an outline of the algorithm

### Sus questions 
- What kind of problems are MOEAs used to solve? 
- How might an MOEA be applied to <insert problem>?
- How does an MOEA differ from a standard EA?
- Explain the concept of dominance in MOEAs
- What is the purpose of sparsity measures within MOEAs?
- Explain how NSGA-II solves multiobjective problems

## Celluar automata 
- What is a cellular automata? What are they used for?
- What is interesting about the game of life?
- What is a spaceship? What is their relevance?
- What is an elementary CA?
- Where do elementary CA rule numbers come from?
- Why iscomputation universality important?

## Artifical GN 
- How does a Boolean network differ from a CA?
- What is an attractor? Why are they of interest from a computational perspective?
- What are the different dynamical regimes that appear in the behaviourof Boolean Networks? Which dynamical regime is associated with computation?
- How might you compute with a Boolean network?
